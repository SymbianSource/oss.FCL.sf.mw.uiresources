\s60\aknlayout2\generated\readme.txt

This readme exists to force the \s60\aknlayout2\generated directory to exist. This is necessary to allow
the layout compiler to run.

The content of this directory is generated in the layout data integration phase with gencode.cmd and
generated code and makefiles are put to version control.
