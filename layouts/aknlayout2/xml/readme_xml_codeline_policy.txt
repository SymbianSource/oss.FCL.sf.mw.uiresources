AknLayout2\xml

Readme file

This file describes the policy for management of XML files in this directory. 

The policy is as follows:

1. All submissions to source control affecting XML files in this directory must conform to this policy. 
2. It is the responsibility of engineers and integration engineers to ensure that this policy is followed. 
3. Any submissions breaking this policy will be rejected and deleted without warning.
4. Rule #3 above applies even if the submission is to fix a showstopper defect.
5. The contents of the XML file in this directory MUST be generated by the Layout Creation Tool.
6. The contents of the XML file in this directory MUST NOT be edited after generation by the Layout Creation Tool.
7. When a new layout or display set is generated using the Layout Creation Tool, and added to source control, it must be in the correct directory, and the directory must contain a shortcut to this readme text file, with the name "readme_VERY_IMPORTANT_DO_NOT_MODIFY_XML_BY_HAND.txt".
8. When the layout creation tool is used to modify the layout specifications, modifications must be exported to XML files corresponding to ALL affected display sets.
9. The layout creation tool must be used on the live database. A local copy of the data must not be used.
10. Once a change has been made to the layout specification, that change still requires approval. However, the exported modified data may be submitted to the build before this approval takes place. 
11. When XML data is exported from the layout creation tool and submitted to source control, the deltas must be examined to see what else has been modified in the interim period. This is an integration issue that must be handled by those responsible for the integration. However, Rule #6 still applies. Therefore, if there are conflicts, they must be resolved inside the Layout Creation Tool, and using the live database.
